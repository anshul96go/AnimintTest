==== Bio of Student ====

I am currently a grad student in Statistics at Montana State University so I have worked with R and ggplot2 for several years.  I developed an R package for the Philadelphia Phillies last year which utilized the ggplot2 package to visualize results.

==== Schedule Conflicts: ====

On August 3, I will be beginning an internship with a Major League Baseball team.  As a result, I will have less time to work on this project in the month of August.  I plan to have my project mostly completed by August.  Then I will spend that month on final touch-ups (if needed).


==== MENTORS ====

Mentor names: Toby Dylan Hocking, Carson Siever, and Susan VanderPlas

Mentor emails: tdhock5@gmail.com, cpsievert1@gmail.com, srvanderplas@gmail.com

Mentor link_ids: 

Have you been in touch with the mentors? When and how?: Yes, I have communicated with them frequently about the project through email over this last week.


==== CODING PLAN & METHODS ====

Describe in detail your plan for completing the work.  What functions will be written, how and when will you do design, how will you verify the results of your coding?  The sub-section headings below are examples only.  Each project is different, please make your application appropriate to the work you propose.  

Describe perceived obstacles and challenges, and how you plan to overcome them.



==== TIMELINE ====

(consult GSOC schedule)

Provide a detailed timeline of how you plan to spend your summer.  Don't leave testing and documentation for last, as that's almost a guarantee of a failed project. 

What is your contingency plan for things not going to schedule? 


==== MANAGEMENT OF CODING PROJECT ====

How do you propose to ensure code is submitted / tested?

The animint project is located on GitHub.  I will fork the repository and submit changes as pull requests on GitHub.  R provides the testthat package to implement unit testing.  This package allows me to write tests to ensure that my code is doing exactly what I intend and to ensure that it doesn't interfere with any of the existing Animint code.

How often do you plan to commit?  What changes in commit behavior would indicate a problem?

Through the end of April, I will be familiarizing myself with Animint so I don't plan to commit very often.  Once April ends, I plan to commit at least a couple times a week through August.  In August, I intend to be mostly finished with the project so I will hopefully be making minor changes once a week or so.  

If I start committing less than once a week, that will be a problem.


==== TEST ====

Describe the qualification test that you have submitted to you project mentors.  If feasible, include code, details, output, and example of similar coding problems that you have solved.
