# AnimintTest
Testing the Animint package for Google Summer of Code.  Unfortunately, using `animint2gist` is not working properly for me so I made a [webpage](https://kferris10.github.io/AnimintTest) to view the easy and medium examples.
## Easy Test
A visualization of the spread of ebola in Liberia in 2014.

## Medium Test
An implementation of Brownian motion using animint.

## Medium-Hard Test
Used [testthat](https://github.com/hadley/testthat) to test that point and text geoms are present, that the legend displays properly, and that the plot has the proper title.
