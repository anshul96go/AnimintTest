# AnimintTest
Testing the Animint package for Google Summer of Code.  Unfortunately, using `animint2gist` is not working properly on my computer so I made webpages to view the easy and medium examples.

## Easy Test
A visualization of the spread of ebola in Liberia in 2014.  [Result](http://kferris10.github.io/AnimintTest-easy/)

## Medium Test
An implementation of Brownian motion using animint.  [Result](http://kferris10.github.io/AnimintTest-medium/)

## Medium-Hard Test
Used [testthat](https://github.com/hadley/testthat) to test that point and text geoms are present, that the legend displays properly, and that the plot has the proper title.
